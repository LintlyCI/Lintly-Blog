Today's update contains an exciting new feature...Python 3 support!

* Python 3 support
* The new `lintly.yml` config file

Previously, Lintly would only lint projects using Python 2.7. That meant that Python 3 only features
like `async def` would result in a `SyntaxError`.

Lintly now lints projects against Python 2.7 by default, but you can use the new `lintly.yml` config
file to specify the Python version you would like to use. For Python 2, Lintly will use Python version
2.7.12. For Python 3, Lintly will use Python version 3.6.0.

To start linting your projects with Python 3, add a file called `lintly.yml` in the root of your
project. The file should have this structure:

```yaml
python:
  version: 3
```

The valid values for `version` are 2 or 3, with 2 being the default if you don't have this file. The
`lintly.yml` file will be home to future lintly configuration options.

If you have any feature requests or notice any bugs then head on over to the [Lintly issue tracker](https://github.com/LintlyCI/Lintly-Issues/issues), or send us a tweet [@LintlyCI](https://twitter.com/LintlyCI).
