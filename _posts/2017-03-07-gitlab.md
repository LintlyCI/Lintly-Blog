A Lintly update was released last night and it came with one big new feature:

**GitLab support!**

Now Lintly will work with both GitHub *and* GitLab. From the home page, click "Register with GitLab,"
give Lintly authorization, then start importing your repos.

Lintly still only works with public repos, but support for private repos is coming soon.

## Conclusion

If you have any feature requests or notice any bugs then head on over to the
[Lintly issue tracker](https://github.com/LintlyCI/Lintly-Issues/issues), or send us a tweet
[@LintlyCI](https://twitter.com/LintlyCI). And as always, happy linting!
